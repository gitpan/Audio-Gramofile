Audio/Gramofile version 0.08
============================

This module provides a Perl interface to Gramofile, a program for recording
gramophone records. It is able to record hours of CD quality music, 
split long sound files in separate tracks, and remove ticks and pops from 
recordings. 

Gramofile was written by Anne Bezemer and Ton Le.

Gramofile is available from http://www.opensourcepartners.nl/~costar/gramofile/

A library, libgramofile, derived from Gramofile, used by this module is 
available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libgramofile

The advantage of using a Perl interface, rather than the curses interface, is
that batch processing of large number of files is easier. Just put all the 
raw .wav files into a directory, start the program, and return much later to 
find a lot of processed files, without having to click-click for every file.
This is useful if you are happy to use the same set of input parameters, or 
just lazy :-)
